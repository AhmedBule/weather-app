# weather-app




=======
###### This is my weather app that I built using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, AND AJAX. I used the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities. After I retrieved my API from OpenWeatherAPI, I used jQuery and the on.click function. Thereafter, I retried the general data. The four important data points that we wanted was city name, wind speed, humidity, and temperature. Afterwards, I also retrieved two data points: the five day forcast and latitude/longtitude. 

###### Users can search the city and future conditions for that city and it is added to the search history. Afterwards, the users are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
