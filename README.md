# weather-app

## This is my weather app that I built using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, AND AJAX. I used the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities. After I retried my API from OpenWeatherAPI, I jQuery and the on.click function. Thereafter, I retried the general data. The four important data points that we wanted was city name, wind speed, humidity, and temperature. Afterwards, I also retrieved two data points: the five day forcast and latitude/longtitude.
